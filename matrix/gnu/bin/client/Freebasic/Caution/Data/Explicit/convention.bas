Explicit Data Conversion
There is an alternative to implicit data conversion, explicit data conversion where
you use one of FreeBasicâ€™s built-in conversion functions. Since these functions are
designed for conversion, they return consistent results and are unlikely to change even if
the implicit rules of the compiler change. Even though it is more work, it is always safer
to explicitly convert data to the needed data type before carrying out operations on that
data.
