Analysis: This program is similar to the program in Listing 4.2 except the
conversion process is from two double-type variables to an integer. Lines 1 and 2 declare
the working variables. Lines 4 and 5 set the values of the two double-type variables. In
line 6 the double-type division result is implicitly converted to an integer, resulting in
precision loss. Line 7 prints the result to the console window and lines 8 and 9 wait for a
key press and end the program.
