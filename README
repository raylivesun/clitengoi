First steps in Bee
Installation

Download the package, unpack it and run the installation script.

    Download the package (Linux 64 bit, Mac).

    Unpack it. If you use the terminal you can type the following command (making sure you are in the right directory):
        (Linux) $ tar xvf bee.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        (Mac) $ tar xvf bee.mac-amd64.tar.gz

    Run: $ cd bee_package
    Run the installation script: $ ./install.sh

Everything (binaries, standard library) is put into the ~/.opt/bee/.
Test a small program

Create a file (hello.b) with the following content:

let main = print_string "Hello World!\n"

Compile this file with the following command:
$ bee -o hello.bc hello.b
bee is the Bee compiler. It compiles source files to portable bytecode executable (not native code).

Run this file with the following command:
$ beerun hello.bc
beerun is the Bee runtime. It runs bytecode executable files.
Note that hello.bc is not an executable file, you cannot run it with $ ./hello.bc .
Test a bigger program

Create a file (test.b) with the following content:

let main = 
  let rec length l =
    case l
     | [] -> 0
     | hd :: tl -> 1 + length tl
    end in 

  let l = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6] in 

  let len = length l in 
  printf "The length of the list is: %i\n" len

Compilation is more complicated because it includes the standard library path and standard library modules:
$ bee -o test -I ~/".opt/bee/standard library" preludedefinitions.b lists.b strings.b printf.b test.b

Running is the same as the previous example:
$ beerun test
